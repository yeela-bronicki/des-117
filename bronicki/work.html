    <p>I am currently a full time student studying Design at UC Davis as well as working part time as Student Photographer for the College of Engineering. </p>
    <p> Most of my studying and work revolves around a computer, with some physical work, like when I create 3D designs, or walking around and taking photographs.</p>
