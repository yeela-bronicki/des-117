        <h2>Comparative Analysis</h2>
        <time datetime="2024-11-05">November 5, 2024</time>
        <p>For my comparative analysis, I researched photography portfolios to get layout inspiration. 
            The first similarity that stood out to me was the inclusion of at least one large photograph on the website's home page, as I expected. While all of them had a logo near the top of the webpage, one of those was a bit more ambiguous and required looking at the tab heading and URL to see their name, or to click on another page. Based on my reaction to these, I plan to include my name on my interactive narrative to make my branding clear from the start.</p>
            
        <img src="images/chris_collado.jpeg" alt="Chris Collado">
        <p><a href="https://www.chriscollado.com/portfolio">https://www.chriscollado.com/portfolio</a> <br>
            As I scrolled through Chris Collado's portrait page, I found the banner a bit distracting as it's a video compared to the still images that comprise his portfolio. While I like the different sizes of images to create visual interest, I would prefer having a slight gap to separate the photos from one another. </p>
            
        <img src="images/bumblegum_photography.jpeg" alt="Bubblegum Photography" width="640">
        <p><a href="https://www.bubblegumphotography.com.au/">https://www.bubblegumphotography.com.au/</a> <br>
            I found the home page of Bubblegum Photography to be visually cohesive, especially with the color palette. The large logo/illustration near the top of the page grabbed my attention before moving on and looking at the photos. While I think this works well for a business that is looking to gain clients, I would want my website to showcase my photography in a simpler way since I don't yet have a specific niche and will be job searching soon.</p>
            
        <p> Other websites I discovered include: <br>
        <a href="https://www.drewthefotographer.com/">DrewTheFotographer</a> <br>
        <a href="https://www.jjulian.photography/">J Julian De Rise Photography</a></p>
            
        <p>Based on my research, I plan to have a minimalistic homepage that links to more in-depth sections, which will have more photos and artist statements.</p>
