        <h2>Internet History Follow-up</h2>
        <time datetime="2024-10-22">October 22, 2024</time>
        <p>The rise of AI has the potential to affect both job and internet security. Since I hope to work in the design field and I use social media, I decided to focus my research on AI's impact on these aspects of my life.</p>

       <p> AI systems require a lot of personal data in order to complete the jobs they were created for. Social media platforms such as Instagram have seen a rise in deepfakes, where someone's image and voice are taken to seem like they said something that they never did. While I personally have seen this done to celebrities due to their popularity, the thought that someone could create a video like that of me is unnerving. </p>
            
       <p> Although it is easy for me to see the negatives of using the Internet due to AI, my research has led me to see some positives. For example, it can more easily detect phishing campaigns and misinformation. While it may not be fully accurate at times, it is relieving to know that AI can warn me if something I see online is likely fake, so I can do my own research.</p>
            
      <p>  While I have used tools in Photoshop to remove an object in the background or expand the background of a photo with the generative fill option, I sometimes worry about my future as a designer due to the trend of AI art. Reading about the potential of this job takeover has been reassuring. While AI can automate some parts of the design process, like suggesting color schemes, and can eliminate other repetitive tasks, at its current stage, it will not replace the need for designers. Instead, AI is a tool that allows us to focus on the creative aspects while making our jobs more efficient.</p>
