        <h2>Example 1: Simple Transition</h2>

        <!-- Put example 1 html here -->
        <div id="ex1"></div>

        <p>On the transitions.css stylesheet, try moving the transition property from the #ex1:hover rule to the #ex1 rule. See what happens! Also try setting the amount of time for the transition to 500ms.</p>
        <p>Example 1 animates the width property, but lots of properties in CSS can be animated. Check out <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animated_properties">this page on the MDN</a>
            for a full list.</p>

        <h2>Example 2: Transition Multiple Properties</h2>

        <!-- Put example 2 html here -->
         <div id="ex2">Hover over me</div>

        <p>Please notice in this example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This example is animating some of the different properties from the list above.</li>
            <li>Multiple properties can be animated by listing them, or you can use 'all' to animate all of them.</li>
            <li>What happens if you move the transition from the hover rule to the #ex2 rule in this example?</li>
            <li>Notice how this content is pushed down as the animation happens.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Example 3: Easing</h2>

        <!-- Example 3 html -->
        <div id="ex3">
            <div id="ex3a">Linear</div>
            <div id="ex3b">ease</div>
            <div id="ex3c">ease-in</div>
            <div id="ex3d">ease-out</div>
            <div id="ex3e">ease-in-out</div>
            <div id="ex3f">custom</div>
        </div>
        <p>Easing can provide a more natural look to an animation. CSS has some presets for linear, ease, ease-in, ease-out and ease-in-out. For a deeper understanding of what exactly these presets are you can check out <a href="https://css-tricks.com/ease-out-in-ease-in-out/">this great article</a> on the CSS Tricks website.
        </p>

        <p>As Chris Coyier notes in his article, the general rule is to ease-in when things are moving out, and ease-out as things are moving in.</p>

        <p>For creating custom animations I like Matthew Lein's CSS easing tool: <a href="https://matthewlein.com/tools/ceaser">Ceaser</a></p>

        <p>Finally, notice that I have separated the transition properties here into "transition-property", "transition-duration", and "transition-timing-function". There is also a "transition-delay" property that can be used to delay a transition from starting. You can also combine all these into the shortcut "transition" property.</p>

        <p>Check out the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition">MDN page on transitions.</a></p>

        <h2>Example 4: Transitioning Specific Properties</h2>

        <p>Sometimes you want some properties to transition but not others. This example shows how you can transition two or more specific properties</p>

        <!-- Put example 4 html here -->
        <div id="ex4"></div>

    </main>
